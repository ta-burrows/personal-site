        <h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹  Iâ€™m Tom Burrows, and Iâ€™m a UX Designer.</h1>
        <p>I currently work at Co-op as an Interaction Designer, focusing on the customer experience for our food business.</p>
      
        <p>I co-run the Debate Club workshop, have worked on our design system, and contribute as a content designer to other areas of the Co-op digital experience.</p>
      
        <p>I believe above all in simplicity. The world seems to get louder and louder and thereâ€™s a lot to take in. Most things are needlessly complicated. I believe in accessibility for all, and transparency. Letâ€™s just make life easier!</p>
      
        <p>I have a background in writing and editing words - and I still write music pieces for the Picky Bastards website - but thatâ€™s another story.</p>
